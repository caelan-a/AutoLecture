# AutoLecture
This project was started to alleviate the outdated unimelb lecture capture system.

It's goals were to:
1. Allow you to download your lectures and store them in an organised way
2. Gather information on the lectures by analysing documents/word analysis on the associated pages. Or by analysing the video for key words
3. Keep track of statistics on how often you watch lectures in addition to notifying you of your current unwatched lectures to help you study better

This project went for a number of months before the lecture capture system was unexpectedly upgraded. This lessened the need for this software and it was used subsequently only for certain modules.
